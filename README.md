# GCP_pub-sub
Develop Terraform code for creating and managing 10,000 Google Pub/Sub topics.
You will need to follow these steps to use Terraform code to create and manage the Google Pub/Sub topics:

1. **Terraform installation:**

   If you havenâ€™t already done so, you need to install Terraform on your local machine.

2. **Service Account Key:**

   You will need a Google Cloud user account key file in JSON format. This special file should have enough permissions to create and manage Pub/Sub topics, service accounts, and other important features. Be sure to download this key and specify its path in your Terraform system.

3. **Google Cloud SDK:**

   Make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured with the correct credentials. You can add the `gcloud auth application-default login` command to the SDK and validate it.

4. **Update Terraform Configuration:**

   Update the Terraform configuration as needed using the appropriate criteria for your Google Cloud service, region, and other configurations. Replace places like `<path-to-your-service-account-key.json>`, `"your-project-id"`, and `"us-central1"` with your actual value.

5. **Terraform Initialization:**

   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your Terraform configuration file is located, and use the following command to start the Terraform working directory:

  " terraform init "

   This command downloads the required provider plugins and configures your working directory.

6. **Terraform Plan :**

   You can set up a schedule to see what changes Terraform will make to your Google Cloud environment. It is good practice to review these changes before implementing them. Run the following command to view the schema

   " terraform plan "

7. **Terraform apply :**

   If you like the layout, you can use modifications to create pubs/subtopics and associated resources. Run the following command to confirm the requested changes

   " terraform apply "

8. **Verfication :**

   After Terraform has completed, you can verify that the Pub/Sub topics have been created by checking your Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line tool.
